# Customer Base System(CBS)

It keeps track of the customer base and therefore of all users enrolled in the environment: patients, doctors, service personnel. 

Each user has their own account to access the environment. Each account is given additional information that the system uses for the correct attribution of the services that belong to that given user, either as a patient or as a medical staff.
