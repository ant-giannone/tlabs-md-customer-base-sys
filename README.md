The system we will cover in this article is part of the Spring Framework :: A gentle introduction series. Specifically, in line with the PoC functionalities, we will develop the functionalities necessary to manage the customer base of our product.  

It manages the customer base: each user can be either a patient or a doctor or a service person in a doctor's office. Each user has an account to access the services provided by the system. Each account is provided with additional information that the system uses for the correct attribution of the services belonging to that particular user, both as a patient and medical staff.

We are going to develop some business scenarios, even if simple, that will concern the following:  

- The registration of a generic user profile, intended by default as patient.
- Account activation for the first access to the system
- Access to the platform as a generic user that initiates the platform's verification of its profile as a doctor qualified to practice its profession.

The details of these three features will be discussed in detail in the next articles, also in terms of User Stories and Acceptance criteria
